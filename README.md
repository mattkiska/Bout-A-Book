# Bout-A-Book
Search for your favorite books, or books that you want to know a bit more about!


Bout-A-Book is a lightweight and easy to use app that allows you to search any book you like and if it is in our database you will be returned the following;

- Author
- Publish Date
- Number of Pages
- Genre of book
- If a photo is available. It will also show you a photo of the book to help make it easier to find a copy if you are someone who enjoys going to the book store and reading a physical copy.

### Our goal is to put everything you want to know about your book in one easy place for you and anyone else to find.

Bout-A-Book utilizes Openlibrary.org for all of the API usage.
